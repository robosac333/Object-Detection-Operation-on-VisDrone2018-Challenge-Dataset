# Object-Detection-Operation-on-VisDrone2018-Challenge-Dataset
Converted the already annotated dataset to YOLO format and trained the CNN Model 

Trained a CNN yolo model to use a VisDrone2018 dataset annotated dataset and validated on test set images and videos to perform object detection and tracking

Following were the validation results
